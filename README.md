# 🎓 First-Year University Projects

This repository showcases Java coding assignments completed during my first year at university, categorized into two semesters: **Introduction to Programming** and **Object-Oriented Programming in Java**. Each project highlights different computer science concepts, including algorithms, data structures, and object-oriented principles.

## 📘 Introduction to Programming

### 1. 🧬 DNA Sequencer
> A program that processes and analyzes DNA sequences using string manipulation and pattern matching. It demonstrates early problem-solving techniques and working with biological data.

### 2. 🧩 N-Puzzle
> Implementation of the classic N-Puzzle game with a focus on search algorithms to find optimal solutions. This project strengthens algorithmic thinking. It also invoves the use of StdDraw for the stdlib.jar library for the game interface.

### 3. 🔢 Sudoku Solver
> A recursive backtracking algorithm designed to solve Sudoku puzzles, ensuring valid configurations across rows, columns, and 3x3 blocks.

## 📘 Object-Oriented Programming in Java

### 1. 🔢 Rich Array & Negadecimal to Decimal Calculator
> Combines custom array data structures with an advanced calculator to convert between negadecimal and decimal number systems.

### 2. ✈️ Trip Advisor (Travel Office Management System)
> A console-based management system for travel bookings, clients, and packages, emphasizing modular and maintainable OOP design.

### 3. 🧩 Squarelotron
> An implementation of the Squarelotron puzzle with rotation mechanics, showcasing object-oriented solutions for grid-based problems.

### 4. ♟️ Chess
> A simplified chess game focusing on game logic and object-oriented design for grid-based movement mechanics.
